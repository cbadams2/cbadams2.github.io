Hi! I live in NYC.

I am currently a physics PhD student at Columbia, and I do gamma-ray astrophysics with the [VERITAS gamma-ray observatory](https://veritas.sao.arizona.edu). Volunteer for [The Remedy Project](https://theremedyproj.org) since 2019.

I enjoy coding and working with large data sets - much of my work has focused on using archival data to search for faint signals.

Big fan of public transport. Love to explore cities, play sports, bike, and garden. Always working to improve access to transit and healthy food, and to end mass incarceration.
