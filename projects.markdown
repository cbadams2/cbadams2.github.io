## ProfanID (2022) [![ProfanID Logo](/assets/images/profanid_logo.png){:class="img-responsive" height="20%" width="20%"}](https://profanid.com)

[ProfanID](https://profanid.com) is the first website I made and it scans lyrics for uncouth language from the [musixmatch.com](https://www.musixmatch.com/) API. The code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/cbadams2/ProfanID).

## OnLibrary (TBD)

An upcoming project that will provide a virtual interpretation of the library / bookstore experience of "judging a book by its cover."

Central to this experience will be its minimal nature. No reviews, no social aspect, just staring at a bunch of book covers, maybe reading the summary, and calling it a day.

This project will be exclusively used to support local booksellers.
